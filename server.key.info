$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

Enter pass phrase for server.key:
Loading 'screen' into random state - done
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:San Francisco
Locality Name (eg, city) []:

Step 3: Remove Passphrase from Key

One unfortunate side-effect of the pass-phrased private key is that Apache will
ask for the pass-phrase each time the web server is started. Obviously this is not
necessarily convenient as someone will not always be around to type in the
pass-phrase, such as after a reboot or crash. mod_ssl includes the ability to
use an external program in place of the built-in pass-phrase dialog, however,
this is not necessarily the most secure option either. It is possible to remove
the Triple-DES encryption from the key, thereby no longer needing to type in a pass-phrase.
If the private key is no longer encrypted, it is critical that this file only be
readable by the root user! If your system is ever compromised and a third party
obtains your unencrypted private key, the corresponding certificate will need
to be revoked. 
With that being said, use the following command to remove the pass-phrase from the key:

cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key


Step 4: Generating a Self-Signed Certificate

At this point you will need to generate a self-signed certificate because you either don't plan on having your certificate signed by a CA, or you wish to test your new SSL implementation while the CA is signing your certificate. This temporary certificate will generate an error in the client browser to the effect that the signing certificate authority is unknown and not trusted.

To generate a temporary certificate which is good for 365 days, issue the following command:

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
Signature ok
